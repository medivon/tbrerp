## Order Workflow Follow-up Questions

No blocking open Order workflow questions remain from the latest Order Q&A round.

The latest 50-question functional readiness round resolved status separation, stock warnings, financial reconciliation, line cancellation, `JOB-O` cancellation ownership, Shipment handoff, and whole-Order cancellation behavior.

## Recently Resolved Order Workflow Questions

### OQ-ORD-001 - Stock-insufficient acknowledgement result

Decision:

- If stock-insufficient confirmation is acknowledged by a permitted Order user, the ready-stock reservation can make stock go negative.
- The negative stock state is intentional visibility for the shortage.

### OQ-ORD-002 - Order recipient snapshot before Shipment exists

Decision:

- A confirmed Order stores its own Order Recipient Detail snapshot.
- Later Customer Detail/address-book changes do not change old Orders.
- Shipment Builder defaults from the Order snapshot and may override recipient/address for that Shipment round only.

### OQ-ORD-003 - Price edit after Payment Record exists

Decision:

- Keep existing Payment Records/slips unchanged.
- If the edited total requires more payment, add a new Payment Record/slip.
- Reduced totals or overpayment are handled through Financial Reconciliation / financial note or follow-up rather than deleting old payment history.

### OQ-ORD-004 - Direct shipment action from follow-up queue

Decision:

- `ออเดอร์ที่ต้องติดตาม` is a follow-up/filter page only.
- It does not create Shipment rounds directly.
- Users open Order Detail to manage selected lines and downstream actions.

### OQ-ORD-005 - Closed / cancelled queue screen shape

Decision:

- `ปิดแล้ว / ยกเลิก` reuses the `ออเดอร์ทั้งหมด` table/layout with the tab/filter applied.
- It does not need a separate screen/prompt/mockup unless future behavior diverges.

### OQ-ORD-006 - Order status vs Shipment status

Decision:

- `สถานะออเดอร์` and `สถานะการจัดส่ง` are separate.
- `รอยืนยันการจัดส่ง` is a Shipment round / shipment-summary state, not a main Order status.
- Main Order statuses are `กำลังดำเนินการ`, `กำลังผลิต`, `พร้อมสร้างรอบจัดส่ง`, `ส่งบางส่วน`, `จัดส่งครบแล้ว`, and `ยกเลิก`.

### OQ-ORD-007 - Financial reconciliation after Order total edits

Decision:

- Normal Payment Records do not block Order operation.
- If an Order edit changes sales total after Payment/COD records exist, Review Changes blocks save until financial evidence or adjustment/refund/credit note reconciles with the new sales total.
- Refund/credit remains a note/follow-up in this scope, not an Order status.

### OQ-ORD-008 - Existing JOB-O cancellation ownership

Decision:

- If `JOB-O` exists, cancellation starts from Job, even if production has not started.
- Order Detail keeps the cancelled custom line visible with reason and excludes it from active status, totals, and shipment selection.

### OQ-ORD-009 - Stock shortage after acknowledgement

Decision:

- Stock shortage is a warning/reporting issue after acknowledgement by an Order-capable user.
- It does not block Order or Shipment operation.
- Shipment Builder shows acknowledgement when selected ready-stock lines have negative/insufficient stock.

## Material / Stock Boundary Follow-up Questions

### OQ-MAT-001 - Supplier/material cardinality

Open:

- Each material item needs a clear supplier link for purchase flow.
- If the same physical material can be bought from multiple suppliers, the next decision should clarify whether the system creates separate Material Items per supplier, or allows multiple suppliers on one Material Item.

Why it matters:

- This affects the Material Stock table, Material Purchase Order line picker, supplier filter, and how strictly purchasing is tied to a supplier.

### OQ-MAT-002 - Material purchase/payment handoff detail

Open but not blocking first UX:

- Material Purchase Order receipt creates Payment Audit Follow-up, not Expense Entry.
- The exact finance screen behavior for recording the later payment/expense can be grilled in the finance/payment round, not inside the material stock boundary.
